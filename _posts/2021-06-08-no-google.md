Google is not what it used to be 15 years ago. Back then it was a young, hungry, progressive, customer-oriented company that desperately needed users and was doing everything to get them. They used to be on your side.

Well, no more. Today’s Google is a greedy and obese monopoly that already has all the users in the world, so naturally its only concern become how to sell users in a most profitable way. Sell you, that is.

So I made it a personal quest to get the amount of Goolge in my life to the absolute minimum. I’m not 100% there yet, but I’m improving every day. Here’re my tips.

# Search

Google search is great. It’s fast, reliable, relevant, its search results are spotless. It’s probably the best search engine in the world, I’m not gonna lie.

All of which is understandable, given that it’s the main source of income for Google. My problem is what they have to do to get there. A few notable examples:

- Blend ad results with organic search:

</figure>

- Allow ad squatting:

<figure>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1168986962704982016?s=20"><img src="search_ransom.png"></a>
</figure>

- Scrap sites content and present results without attribution:

<figure>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/randfish/status/1389281635644755975"><img src="search_crawl.png"></a>
</figure>

- Use their position to force media companies into vendor locking with AMP, which moved hosting and control to Google’s premises:

<figure>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/mnot/status/1359749179682136064"><img src="search_amp.png"></a>
</figure>

And, obviously, Google Search collects shit ton of data about you and shares it with who-knows-who. If you just searched for a stool sample container on Google, rest of the internet already knows that.

Finally, visually Google SERP is hard to look at:

<figure>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls><source src="search_design.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
</figure>

Instead of a linear and streamlined list of consistently looking results, we get a cacophony of various blocks with different designs all fighting for your attention. Stories first place? Seriously?

<figure>
    <img src="search_result.png">
</figure>

Page title (the most important part of the result!) placed second, after page location? And no real URL?

<figure>
    <img src="search_1999.jpg">

</figure>

The solution? Switch to another provider. My choice is [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).

Now, you might have some concerns. Let me address those.

“Aren’t DuckDuckGo search results worse?” Yes they are. Again, I’m not going to pretend they are as good as Google’s. They are not. And this was my biggest concern before making the switch, too.

But you know what? After five or so years of using DDG, I learned one thing: they are _good enough_. For 99% queries I make, I get what I need in the first three results anyway, either in Google or in DDG. So what difference does it really make?

I still fall back to Google occasionally when doing some complex queries, e.g. invesigating a rare error message. It happens maybe once a week. The rest of the time I make hundreds of queries every day on DuckDuckGo and am happy with the results.

“Don’t they also sell ads?” Yes, they do. The only difference is that they do not track you. If me, you or anyone else in the world seached for “dishwasher”, we’d all see the exact same ad. And we’ll continue seeing it no matter what we keep doing or searching on the internet.

Let’s make an experiment, actually. These are the ads I see in June 2021:

<figure>
    <img src="search_dishwasher.png">
</figure>

What do you see? Click [here](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=dishwasher&ia=web) and compare.

Ads without tracking is simple, fair and profitable enough model to keep search engine running. So why does Google spend so much effort to track you? There’s no hard need, they just chose to.

Oh, and the UI of DDG is much more pleasing, too.

# Chrome

I switched away from Chrome when they [added a mandatory Google login](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942252) to the browser itself.

<figure>
    <img src="chrome_login.png">
    Why do I have to look at my Google Account face 24/7 all over the internet?
</figure>

You see, browser for me should be a neutral party. Because internet is neutral. It doesn’t belong to anyone.

Naturally, a tool I use to browse the internet shouldn’t show preference or have special treatment for some sites over the others. And most certainly I don’t want to be logged out of my browser when I log out of Gmail.

Imagine if your car showed preference for a gas from a particular petrol company? Or your printer only worked with a company-certified ink? Not ok, right?

Well, when an ad company makes a free browser, sooner or later they will want to make profit. And this time is now.

This is the list of Chrome issues I had collected over the years:

- Plans to cripple ad blockers AND lie about the real reason behind the change:

    <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-backtracks-on-chrome-modifications-that-would-have-crippled-ad-blockers/"><img src="chrome_manifest_v3.png"></a>
</figure>

- Intentionally break Google products (e.g. YouTube) in competing browsers:

<figure>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18697824"><img src="./chrome_competitors.png"></a>
</figure>

- Implement APIs everyone else thinks are bad idea:

<figure>
    <a href="https://webapicontroversy.com/"><img src="chrome_apis.png"></a>
</figure>

- Rush backward-incompatible updates that [break other people’s sites](https://tonsky.me/blog/chrome-intervention/) (my project was personally hurt by this).
- Not allowing you to clear Google-related cookies:

<figure>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ctavan/status/1044286636991877120"><img src="chrome_cookies.png"></a>
</figure>

- [Affect Mac performance even when not running](https://chromeisbad.com/).
- Plans to give advertisers [even more data about you](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/google-testing-its-controversial-new-ad-targeting-tech-millions-browsers-heres) than they can possibly collect themselves.
- Occasionally block competitors extensions [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/745), [Search by Image](https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/issues/63).
- Monthly updates in DevTools console (it’s a browser, not a magazine).

My choice? Firefox. It’s fast. It can be made pretty with a little tuning. It has its own, completely independent HTML and JS engines, providing backpressure for Google monopolistic abuse of standards. It has real ad blocker! And it doesn’t show you your Google login front and center even when you are on other sites.

Safari is great, too.

The web is great not because we have a single great browser. It’s great because we have a variety of them. The rise of the web coincidented with the fall of IE6. And Chrome is the new IE6. So let’s not repeat our mistakes.



# Gmail

My issues with GMail, apart from obviously spying on my every letter and showing me ads?

The amount of features I don’t need. Very bad Settings UI. The maibox UI that doesn’t get better with redesign. This is hideous:

Also, [tracking my clicks in my own mail](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/12/14/gmail-click-time-link-protections/) is not nice.

Compared to the browser and the search engine, switching mail seems like a much harder task. People depend on my email address! Services, too.

Well, the good news of switching _from_ Gmail is that Gmail is free, so you can keep it around forever. This makes everything SO much easier.

Here are my tips:

- Get your own domain name and set up an email address there. That way you can change provider in the future without people even knowing about it. I can’t change provider for prokopov@gmail.com, but I sure can for niki@tonsky.me

- Get a paid email provider. If you pay for the service, they’ll have no reason to spy on you or sell you the ads.

- Set up forwarding from Gmail to your new address (duh).

My big concern was that changing emails might be hard or even impossible because it’s a rare use case for web services.

Turned out most of the services are pretty cool and straightforward about it. You just go to the profile and change it, like a username. Most of the times it’s easier than changing a password!

But then, ow would I know _where_ to change email? There’re so many services I use!

That was my another concern. This is what I did: I created a filter in the new email that collects all the forwarder letters. When I got a new one, I went to that service and changed the email in the profile.

After a week, I was done with all the essential services, nice and easy, without even remembering all of them. After a month, I was done even with a non-essential ones.

The only letters I get in my old Gmail address today are spam or spam-ish. And Google’s correspondence, of course, which is kind of the same. My old inbox today:

![]()

My new provider? I chose FastMail. They are paid, they have really fast web UI (thus _fast_ mail). It looks dated a bit, but I am willing to tolerate it for its extraordinary speed and responsiveness. But if you decide to go with a Mail app, it’s cool too. Hey, their IMAP works better than Gmail’s!

Here’s [an affiliated link](), if you decide to use FastMail too. Here’s [the normal one]().

ProtonMail was another alternative I considered. Hey.com also looks great, but might not be for everyone.

# Android

Not much choice here, really, and thus no surprise: I switched to iPhone from Android.

I’m not gonna say that Apple is perfect or is a saint. Of course they are not, and by using iPhone you are selling yourself to another huge faceless soul-less company.

But I just get too nervous when a single vendor provides and can access everything I use: phone, mail, search, browser, photos, videos, maps, cloud storage. This setup for Google is like volunarily letting fox in a hen of your private life. Not funny.

At least with Apple, they only provide parts of the stack, which helps me deal with the anxiety.

Another plus of going with Apple is that they are notoriously bad at web services and ads, and recently decided: “since we can’t compete there, let’s at least make life difficult for those who can”. Which is fine by me. Whoever wins, I win, too.

</figure>

Going with Apple seems to be a more further-proof, too. iPhone 6s (2015) just got the latest iOS version. Google Pixel 3a (2019), well:

<figure>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26383058"><img src="./pixel.png"></a>
</figure>

You can’t disable location reporting!!!

# Google Maps

Still figuring this one out. In Russia there’s nothing better than 2Gis, in other places, well, I’m still deciding between Apple Maps and Maps.me.

# YouTube

Another hard decision. I hate the platform, but the content is great, and there seems to be no alternative.

I plan to self-host videos of my own talks, destroyallsoftware-style. Streaming goes through Twitch. But everything else is there, and it’s hard to ignore.

I wish I could not use YouTube, but I can’t.

# Meet

Meet is horrible! It makes my otherwise top-of-the-line Macbook Pro crawl on its knees every time it starts, it constantly breaks here and there, it doesn’t work in Firefox anymore, and doesn’t support custom cameras in Safari.

Avoid at all costs.

# Hangouts, Duo, Allo

Don’t be ridicoulous. Nobody uses those.

# Google Photos

Photos naturally migrated from Google to Apple when I switched from Android to iPhone. It wasn’t a conscious choice, but hey, at least it’s not Google anymore.

If I’d needed more from those I would maybe look for alternatives. But even now it’s fine as it is.

# Products I don’t really need

# Google Drive

Lucky for me, Google Drive is already so bad the only reason to use it is some free storage they offer when you buy Google Phone? I don’t know.

I choose Syncthing and wrote [an extensive post about it](). Holds true to this day.

P.S. Dropbox and iCloud suck too.

# Google Docs

Local markdown files work great for my writing, and I rarely collaborate on text documents with someone else. So I just don’t need Google Docs.

But if I needed to chose, there’s plenty of options: Notion, Coda, Dropbox Paper (even though Dropbox is consistenly getting worse, Paper looks decent), Roam.

# Log in with Google

You all have probably heard stories about people getting locked out of their life after their Google account was deactivated for no apparent reason? People lose everything: their YouTube channel, their mail, thus the access to third-party sites, their documents, photos — everything is gone in an instant and lost in the statistics. It’s rare, but the effects are devastating.

<figure>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Cleroth/status/1318911490863337472"><img src="./account_blocked.png"></a>
</figure>

Andrew was developing Terraria for the Google’s own Stadia platform at the moment, but even that didn’t save him:

<figure>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661841220730882"><img src="./account_blocked_2.png"></a>
</figure>

And don’t get your hopes up thinking this might be resolved: typically, Google doesn’t have live people in support you can talk to (not for free products, at least, such as Google Account).

The point when I finally broke was when Google started aggressively pushing these horrific popups to _third-party_ sites:

<figure>
    <img src="./login_banner.png">
</figure>

THIS IS NOT OK, Google. You are covering half of the content I’m interested in while offering me a feature I don’t want.

Mind you, what makes it worse is that this HUGE popup gets shown immediately on page load—I didn’t even clicked on the Log in/Sign up yet! This is some hostage tactics, not a fair offer.

I am also not comfortable with Reddit knowing the full list of my email addresses. I know that deep down the implementation this part might be actually isolated from Reddit, but it _doesn’t look like it_.

So why risk your entire life on Google’s good will (especially now that they abandoned their famous “Don’t be evil” motto)? I see no reason.

The alternative is password manager + register via email. It offers secure, easy to use and no-single-point-of-failure alternative. I’m on 1Password and loving it.

Should I mention you shouldn’t use Gmail for “register with email”? You shouldn’t.
